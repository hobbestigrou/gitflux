gitflux
=======

The goal is to be able to describe "any" workflow, based on different
branch types. The description would fit in a configuration file that
can be stored in the repository using the policy.

Each gitflow command (except init and version) is named after a type
of branch.

The common subcommands are:
- list:      list all branches of the given type
- start:     create a new branch of the given type
- finish:    merge back and delete a branch of the given type

Other subcommands include:
- publish:   create remote branch
- track:     track a remote branch
- diff:      show a diff with the root branch
- rebase:    rebase on the root branch
- checkout:  checkout the branch
- pull:      pull from the remote
