NAME
    Git::Flux - A Perl port of gitflow

DESCRIPTION
    We like gitflow and we like Perl and when we heard gitflow needs to be
    rewritten in order to be more portable, we decided to get in gear.

    "gitflux" is the love child or Perl and gitflow.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    Create a new object of Git::Flux.

   dir
    The directory which the Git::Flux instance will be working on.

    You can also set this using the "GITFLUX_DIR" environment variable.

   repo
    Internal Git::Repository object that Git::Flux uses to do all the "Git"
    work.

    You can construct your own and provide it on initialize.

  run
  create_repo
    A small helper function to create a repository. The directory is taken
    from the "dir" hash key in the object. If one does not exist (that means
    it was not provided in "new"), it uses the current directory.
